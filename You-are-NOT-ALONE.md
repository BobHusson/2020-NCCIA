# NCCIA 2020 You are NOT ALONE!
## 3 practical things you can do to engage your students
### (was: _3â€™s a Charm! Proven Techniques to Involve Your Students and Get to Know Your Class_ )

_Session 4: Wednesday 3:30-4:45 Room 180_

_Session 8: Thursday 3:30-4:45 Room 227_

If you teach online or even hybrid, you may find you're disconnected from your students.
You don't know them, and they don't know each other - and they don't even know how
many people are in the class alongside them! Come learn how with judicious use of
journals, an introduction wiki, and a general discussion forum, you can break thru the wall
of silence between you, your class, and your students.

This lively interactive presentation will show you some time-tested and proven techniques to getting to know your students, and helping them get to know each other. These will increase engagement in your courses regardless of delivery method, and you can use them in any learning environment. They are not dependent on one another so you can pick and choose what works for you, your subject, and your students. We'll also cover bonus items to spice up your course, and related tips along the way!
