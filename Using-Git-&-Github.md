## Just-Do-It!

_Session 1: Wednesday 9:00-10:15 Room 154_

_Session 10: Friday 10:30-11:45 Room 154_

We'll conduct a hands-on interactive exercise covering the basics of github and how to
get your students (and you) comfortable with using the world's leading version control tool
and site. Using a simple case-study based standard introductions, we'll together build up
a webpage that everyone can edit together. Please try to have your github account setup
and confirmed before the session.
